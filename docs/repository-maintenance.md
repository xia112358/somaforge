# Repository maintenance

## Maintained code and entrypoints

This workstation's large runtime data is held outside the checkout at
`/home/xiaz/somaforge-data/current`, reached through the `runtime/current`
directory symlink. A fresh clone can use a local directory or an explicitly
selected external data root through `scripts/bootstrap_runtime.py`. See
[installation](install.md) and [repository data](repository-data.md) for setup,
the code/data boundary and backup requirements. Moving data does not change
baseline weights, contact labels or losses.

| Area | Implementation | Entrypoint / tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assets, FK, contact semantics | `packages/somaforge_core` | `scripts/check_asset_manifest.py`, package tests |
| Motion editing and augmentation | `packages/motion_edit` | `motion-edit generate-ref`, `motion-edit contact-editor`, package tests |
| Predictor and Infiller | `packages/generator` | `python -m generator.train_full1000_position`, package tests |
| Contact optimization | `packages/contact_solver` | package API; diagnostics under `research/`; package tests |
| Newton WBT | `src/holosoma` | `train_agent.py`, `eval_agent.py`, `replay.py`, `run_sim.py`; `scripts/train_motion_edit_policy_finetune.py` for edited references |
| PHP grouped experts | `scripts/train_php_wbt.py` | Explicit group training; use `--help` for current arguments |
| Modular experts and distillation | Native WBT managers and `RoutedDistillPPO` | [Configuration and invocation guide](wbt-modular-experiments.md); dense/sparse/force experts and student |
| Native contact-reference preparation | `scripts/record_wbt_contact_reference.py`, `scripts/combine_wbt_manifests.py` | Independent recording/manifest commands; manually supplied expert checkpoints |
| Retargeting | `src/holosoma_retargeting` | separate retargeting environment |

Shared direct Newton collision queries and canonical self-collision filters live
in `somaforge_core.newton_collision` and `somaforge_core.newton_collision_filter`.
Tracking imports the filter directly from core; it does not initialize Motion Edit.
`contact_solver` depends on core, while Motion Edit and Generator depend on the
solver and core. The solver has no dependency on the editing application.
The two former `motion_edit.generation` modules were archived and recycled;
current imports use core without forwarding modules. Numerical implementations,
collision filters, margins and authority assets are unchanged.

The follow-up acceptance record is
`runtime/current/archives/package_simplification_followup_20261010/acceptance.json`.
It records 1093 package tests (plus 3 subtests), 58 entrypoint checks, and bounded
real Tracking training/evaluation, edited-reference policy fine-tuning/evaluation,
and Generator scratch training/evaluation. Training now initializes the existing
Newton API bridge after AppLauncher, matching evaluation; no solver parameters
or Predictor implementation were changed. Smoke checkpoints are temporary
outputs, not new baselines or required inputs. These checks validate working
entrypoints and finite updates, not convergence or full-trajectory acceptance.

Current implementations and ordinary tests import the owning package directly.
`climb00_pipeline` contains aliases for historical imports and module CLI calls;
its module-identity tests and frozen reproduction dependencies remain supported.
It contains no independent model, solver or dataset implementation. It is excluded
from the default workspace, installation and subprocess search paths. Historical
reproduction opts in through its [package instructions](../packages/climb00_pipeline/README.md).

The maintained full1000 trainer uses `generator.training_data`,
`generator.scene_workers` and `generator.research.isolated_gradients`, rather
than importing training scripts from `tmp/`. Query checkpoint, source scene
manifest and model inspection paths are explicit configuration fields.

The current baseline is selected by [`baselines/current.json`](../baselines/current.json):
[`predictor.v1_latest.20261010`](../baselines/predictor_v1_latest_20261010/README.md).
It records v1, loaded-material207_joint_v12 data, keep-patch weight 1 and the fixed
step1000 comparison checkpoint. New scratch runs use a fresh output directory
and do not load that checkpoint. Cleanup does not approve historical data variants.

## Visualization

The supported browser entry is `motion-edit contact-editor`: `--motion-id` opens
registered editing/playback; `--review` opens canonical NPZ sequences or JSON pose
comparisons in the same Three.js page. See the
[playback documentation](../packages/motion_edit/README.md#unified-playback-and-experiment-review).
The packaged page references the current JS/CSS bundle in `web_dist/index.html`.
Historical diagnostic contact flags remain unverified; playback does not infer
contact truth from geometry or force thresholds.

There is no maintained standalone Viser, workbench server or force-retarget CLI.
Retargeting does not expose `retargeter.visualize` or `retargeter.debug`.
Simulation Kit rendering is controlled by AppLauncher.
Remote simulation playback uses the same evaluator with `--visualizer kit` and
`--livestream 1`; see the [modular playback guide](wbt-modular-experiments.md#evaluate-or-replay-separately)
and [installation guide](install.md). TensorBoard reads the selected training run
directory independently of Kit. A browser Contact Editor review does not run the
policy or certify native contact execution.
`export-manifest` and `export-split-npz` require `--motion-version-id`; the old
layer `--source` path is rejected.

## Data and retention

| Content | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Formal motion/dataset archives | `runtime/current/motions/` |
| Formal checkpoints | `runtime/current/models/` |
| Local asset, data and acceptance indexes | `runtime/current/manifests/` |
| Tracked asset and training contracts | `configs/` |
| Diagnostics and temporary work | project `tmp/` |
| Frozen experiment source/configuration | `baselines/` |

Root `data`, `logs` and `tmp` are symlinks into `runtime/current/holosoma`.
Required inputs must never live under `tmp/`. Persistent native build caches
live under `runtime/current/cache/`; retained experiment inputs and launch
snapshots live under `runtime/current/archives/`. Temporary outputs may be
removed only after checking references and confirming the itemized list.
Do not rewrite frozen source snapshots to look like current code.

Use [`baselines/current.json`](../baselines/current.json) and
[`baselines/archives.json`](../baselines/archives.json) for current and archived
Predictor records. scratch_recipe.20261002 and control500 were archived in place
on 2026-10-10; their historical weights, data, source snapshots and launch records
remain available. The historical direct-infiller corpus is described in
[its recipe](history/climb00_direct_infiller_baseline.md), not a current training admission.

`runtime/current/manifests/repository_cleanup_20260928.json` is a historical
retention inventory, not the current baseline or a training admission registry.
It predates the explicitly approved 2026-10-02 retirement of corrected1000 and
therefore includes paths that no longer exist. Consult current baseline records
and actual references before any cleanup. Tracked upstream motion/examples also
require dependency-specific review; the audit lists them rather than removing them.

## Cleanup rules and record

File changes require a plan and confirmation under root `AGENTS.md`. Deletions
require an itemized confirmation and use the system recycle bin. Never blanket
clear `tmp/`, discard untracked research, stop training, relabel datasets or
promote a baseline as a side effect of cleanup. Keep changes reviewable until a
separate commit/push request.

Earlier cleanup moved 35 tests to their implementation owners and retired old
Motion Edit handlers, viewers and the LTE adapter. The 2026-09-28 movement and
verification are recorded in
`runtime/current/manifests/repository_cleanup_20260928.json`; the former
`tmp/repository_cleanup_20260928/` diagnostics were later recycled.
That pass verified 755 tests and 3 subtests plus 870 statically parsed Python
files; these counts are historical, not current verification results.

The 2026-10-10 maintenance pass replaces legacy imports in 16 ordinary root tests
with canonical package imports. It removes only the four approved unreferenced
web JS bundles, empty `source/`, root Python/pytest caches and the cache-only
`packages/climb00_pipeline/tests/` directory. Compatibility tests, Predictor
implementation, current baseline, formal data and checkpoints remain intact.
Caches may be recreated by normal tooling. Movement and verification records
for this pass are historical; the former `tmp/repository_cleanup_20261010/`
diagnostics were recycled in the separately confirmed cleanup. Verification passed
85 affected/compatibility tests, statically parsed 959 Python files without errors,
and validated both the asset and training manifests.

The broader reorganization keeps the maintained Tracking, Motion Edit and
Generator interfaces in the table above. Historical reports now live under
[docs/history](history/README.md). The old direct-infiller launcher and unused
editor-cut forwarding module were moved to the recycle bin after an itemized
confirmation. CI runs `scripts/check_repository.py` instead of the removed
GMVQ checker; it covers package, test, app and baseline changes. The audit also
rejects retired entrypoints, default legacy search paths and missing workflow
scripts. The former `tmp/repository_reorganization_20261010/` diagnostics were recycled;
current retained verification is indexed in
`runtime/current/manifests/repository_tmp_cleanup_acceptance_20261010.json`.

## Verification

Static source/config/import audit and manifest checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_repository.py --output tmp/repository_audit.json
source scripts/source_somaforge.sh
python scripts/check_asset_manifest.py
python scripts/check_training_manifest.py
```

Package and contact-pipeline tests require the project's Newton environment:

```bash
source scripts/source_isaaclab3_newton_setup.sh
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 PYTHONPATH="$PWD/scripts${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}" \
  python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider \
  packages tests/test_newton_contact_pipeline.py -q
```

Root regression tests import their owning packages directly. Preserved experimental
helpers live under `generator.research.archived_experiments` and
`contact_solver.research`; they do not expose old training CLIs. The teacher
loader test creates its own synthetic fixture, and does not pass silently when
an external dataset is missing. Local historical corpus integration tests read
explicit formal archive paths, not `tmp/`.

The temporary-input migration preserves motion/checkpoint bytes and frozen
source snapshots. Two registered Tracking manifests now live under
`runtime/current/motions/wbt/`; their relative and absolute input closure is
preserved. JSON path edits also refresh associated file hashes. Archived labels
and preprocessing caches are not re-certified by this migration.
The complete local source/target hash ledger is
`runtime/current/archives/preserved_inputs_20261010/migration.json`.

The repository audit rejects temporary-source imports, temporary data/model
reads and temporary persistent caches. Temporary diagnostic output is allowed.
Tests are also checked with workspace `tmp/` reads explicitly denied.

After the separately confirmed cleanup, 2807 migrated originals (about 3.8 GB)
were moved with `gio trash`; each has a verified replacement and system-trash
receipt. Verification passed 1091 package tests, 247 root unit tests and 19
Tracking preset tests, plus 3 subtests, with workspace temporary inputs denied.
Eight maintained CLI help checks, native Coal loading and both asset/training
manifest validators passed. Training E2E workflows are outside this cleanup
verification. The persistent verification and receipt ledger is
`runtime/current/manifests/repository_tmp_input_migration_20261010.json`.

IsaacLab/CUDA tests require the host environment. Static/unit checks do not
establish trajectory acceptance or policy execution quality.

For modular WBT changes, the focused CPU regression set is:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_wbt_modular_experiments.py \
  src/holosoma/holosoma/config_values/tests/test_experiment_presets.py \
  src/holosoma/holosoma/utils/tests/test_eval_utils.py -q
```

These cover configuration, student observation boundaries, teacher routing,
contact freshness and checkpoint reconstruction. Short GPU smoke runs additionally
checked dense/sparse/force updates, distillation, independent evaluation and exact
model/optimizer/probe-history restoration. They do not establish convergence or
full-size throughput. New native contact labels use constraint activation plus
allocation and shared surface selection; older eight-part threshold/hysteresis
masks remain historical force evidence and are not silently certified.


The Motion Edit detail cleanup unifies editor and CLI generation through
`motion_edit.generation.jobs.generate_candidate`, removes the retired segment
output setting and obsolete solver kwargs, and rebuilds saved plans from verified
source contacts without copying labels to the candidate. Historical object-typed
text arrays were normalized without changing any numeric motion arrays; the
original is archived under
`runtime/current/archives/motion_edit_interface_cleanup_20261010/` and was moved
with `gio trash`. Generated versions remain playback candidates until their own
native validation. This cleanup does not change Predictor data, loss or weights.
